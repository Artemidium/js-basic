# Tasks

# Objects

1. Create a object and using `defineProperty` define not writable property, not enumerable property and not
   configurable property. (PS: in real programming life I think you will never use it :) just for you to know)
2. Make a function which will delete object key by reference, and other one - pure function.
3. Pass object values to function using destruction.
4. Add key/value to object using dynamic key value.

#Additional

1. Generate array with keys, and array with values. Iterate through arrays and assign key/values to object.
